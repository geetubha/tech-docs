# System Design Question and Answers

**Q: What is the CAP theorem, and why is it important in distributed systems?**

**A:** The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only achieve two out of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. It's important because it guides the design of distributed systems, helping engineers choose the right trade-offs based on the system's needs.

**Q: How does a load balancer work, and why is it used?**

**A:** A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. It's used to improve system performance, reliability, and efficiency by balancing the load, reducing bottlenecks, and providing fault tolerance.

---

**Q: What's the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**

**A:** SQL databases are relational and use structured query language, with a fixed schema. They're great for complex queries and ACID transactions. NoSQL databases are non-relational and schema-less, offering more flexibility and scalability, often used for handling large amounts of unstructured data.

---

**Q: Can you explain eventual consistency?**

**A:** Eventual consistency means that given enough time, all replicas of data in a distributed system will converge to the same value. It allows temporary inconsistencies during network partitions or delays but ensures that eventually, all nodes will have the same data.

---

**Q: What is microservices architecture, and how does it differ from monolithic architecture?**

**A:** Microservices architecture breaks an application into small, independent services, each handling a specific function. It offers flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance. In contrast, a monolithic architecture builds everything into a single codebase, which can become complex and challenging to scale.

---

**Q: How do you ensure data security in a distributed system?**

**A:** Ensuring data security in a distributed system involves measures like encryption (for data at rest and in transit), authentication, authorization, regular security audits, and adhering to best practices and compliance standards.

---

**Q: What is horizontal scaling, and how does it differ from vertical scaling?**

**A:** Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to a system, while vertical scaling means increasing the resources of an existing machine. Horizontal scaling offers better fault tolerance and can be more cost-effective, while vertical scaling might hit a physical limit.

Certainly! Here are more conceptual questions that could be part of FAANG interviews:

---

**Q: What is the difference between strong consistency and eventual consistency?**

**A:** Strong consistency ensures that all reads receive the most recent write, providing real-time consistency. Eventual consistency allows temporary inconsistencies but ensures that all replicas will eventually have the same data, given enough time.

---

**Q: How does sharding work in a database, and why is it used?**

**A:** Sharding is the practice of splitting a database into smaller, more manageable parts, or shards. It's used to improve performance, scalability, and manageability, especially in large-scale systems.

---

**Q: What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and how does it enhance web performance?**

**A:** A CDN is a network of geographically distributed servers that deliver content to users from the nearest server. It enhances web performance by reducing latency, offloading traffic from the origin server, and providing caching.

---

**Q: Can you explain the concept of idempotence in the context of RESTful APIs?**

**A:** Idempotence means that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. In RESTful APIs, methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, ensuring that repeating these requests won't change the outcome.

---

**Q: What's the role of a reverse proxy, and how does it differ from a forward proxy?**

**A:** A reverse proxy represents the server, forwarding client requests to backend servers. It's used for load balancing, caching, and security. A forward proxy represents the client, forwarding client requests to the internet. It's used for content filtering and privacy.

---

**Q: How do optimistic and pessimistic locking differ in database management?**

**A:** Optimistic locking allows concurrent access and checks for conflicts at commit time, rolling back if conflicts occur. Pessimistic locking locks resources during access, preventing conflicts but potentially leading to contention and reduced concurrency.

---

**Q: What is eventual consistency, and how does it differ from causal consistency?**

**A:** Eventual consistency ensures that all replicas will eventually have the same data but allows temporary inconsistencies. Causal consistency maintains the order of causally related operations, ensuring that the cause is reflected before the effect across all nodes.

---

**Q: Can you explain the concept of stateless architecture?**

**A:** Stateless architecture means that each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it. There's no stored session information on the server, making it more scalable and easier to manage, often used in RESTful services.

---

**Q: What is the MapReduce programming model, and where is it used?**

**A:** MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster. It consists of a Map step that processes input data and a Reduce step that aggregates the results. It's widely used in big data processing, such as in Apache Hadoop.

These additional questions delve into various aspects of system design, databases, web performance, consistency models, and more. They reflect the depth and breadth of understanding expected in FAANG interviews, where candidates must demonstrate not only knowledge but also the ability to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.
