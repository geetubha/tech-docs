# What is the difference between a forward proxy and a reverse proxy?

A forward proxy and a reverse proxy serve different purposes and are used in different contexts within network architecture. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

## Forward Proxy

- **Client-Side Proxy:** Acts on behalf of the client (user) and forwards requests from clients to servers.
- **Purpose:** Mainly used for content filtering, bypassing geo-restrictions, bandwidth usage, and privacy (e.g., hiding the client's IP address).
- **Example:** A user accessing a restricted website through a forward proxy to bypass regional limitations.

## Reverse Proxy

- **Server-Side Proxy:** Acts on behalf of the server and forwards requests from clients to one or more backend servers.
- **Purpose:** Mainly used for load balancing, caching, compression, and SSL termination, enhancing the performance and security of the web application.
- **Example:** A website using a reverse proxy to distribute incoming traffic among several servers to balance the load and prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

Here is snapshot that explains the differces pictorially.
