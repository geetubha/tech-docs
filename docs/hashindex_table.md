| **2. Define Function**| Define a hash function that takes a key and returns an index in the array. | Define a hash function that takes a key and returns an index in the array.                             |
| **3. Handle Collisions**| N/A (Does not handle collisions)                          | Define a method to handle collisions (e.g., chaining or open addressing).                              |
| **4. Insert**         | Take a key and value. Use the hash function to find the index. Store the value at that index. | Take a key and value. Use the hash function to find the index. Handle collision if occurs. Store the key-value pair at the index. |
| **5. Retrieve**       | Take a key. Use the hash function to find the index. Return the value at that index. | Take a key. Use the hash function to find the index. Navigate collision structure if needed. Return the value for the key. |

### Conclusion

- **Hash Index:** An in-memory structure that provides quick data retrieval, often used in caching and real-time analytics.
- **Hash Table:** A more complex on-disk structure that can handle collisions, used in various applications like database indexing, network routing, and fraud detection.
- **Applications:** Both are essential in online processing systems, where their ability to provide quick access to data supports real-time or near-real-time operations.

#### **Hash Index Name Origin:**

 The name "hash index" comes from the use of a hash function to quickly calculate the index in an array where a value should be stored or retrieved. It's a structure that leverages the uniform distribution property of the hash function for efficient data retrieval.

| Term          | Description                                                                                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hash Function** | A mathematical function that takes an input (key) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a numerical value. |
| **Purpose of Hash Function** | Distributes the keys uniformly across an array, minimizing the chance that two keys will hash to the same index.         |
| **Hash Index**   | Uses a hash function to map keys directly to indices in an array for storing or retrieving values.                      |
| **Naming of Hash Index** | The term "hash" refers to the use of the hash function, and "index" refers to the quick indexing capability it provides.  |
