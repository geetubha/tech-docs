# Inverted Index

An inverted index is a data structure used to store a mapping from words or terms to their locations in a set of documents. It's called "inverted" because it inverts the relationship between documents and terms. Here's how it falls into the category of batch processing and the algorithm for its construction:

## Inverted Index and Batch Processing

- **Large-Scale Processing:** Creating an inverted index requires processing vast amounts of data, making it suitable for batch processing.
- **Non-Real-Time Requirement:** The index doesn't need to be updated instantly with every new document, so it can be processed in batches.
- **Efficiency:** Batch processing allows for optimization of resources, making the construction of an inverted index more efficient.

### Algorithm for Inverted Index Construction

| Step  | Description                                                                                   | Example or Details                                               |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **Tokenizer:** Break the text into individual words or tokens.                                | Input: Raw text documents; Output: List of tokens.               |
| 2     | **Linguistic Modules:** Apply stemming, stop words removal, and lowercasing.                   | Stemming: "running" to "run"; Remove: "and," "the"; Lowercase.  |
| 3     | **Initialize Index:** Create an empty hash table or dictionary to store the index.             | Use a data structure like a hash table or dictionary.            |
| 4     | **Iterate through Tokens:** Note the document ID and position for each token.                   | For each token, add the document ID and position to the index.   |
| 5     | **Handle Duplicates:** If a token appears multiple times, append new locations to the existing entry. | If token is already in the index, append new locations.          |
| 6     | **Compress (Optional):** Compress the index to save storage space.                             | Apply a compression algorithm if needed.                         |
| 7     | **Store:** Save the index to disk for later retrieval.                                         | Store the index in a file or database for future use.            |

This table provides a clear and concise overview of the steps involved in constructing an inverted index, including tokenization, linguistic processing, and handling of duplicates. It's a **fundamental concept in information retrieval** and is often used in search engines and other applications that require efficient text searching.

## Example Code (Python)

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def build_inverted_index(docs):
    index = defaultdict(list)
    for doc_id, text in enumerate(docs):
        tokens = tokenize(text)  # Custom function to tokenize text
        for token in tokens:
            token = stem(token)  # Custom function to stem token
            token = token.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
            if token not in stop_words:  # Assuming stop_words is a predefined set
                index[token].append((doc_id, tokens.index(token)))
    return index
```

### Conclusion

The inverted index is a powerful tool in information retrieval, especially in search engines. Its construction involves several steps, including tokenization and linguistic processing, and is often handled as a batch process due to the large-scale data processing involved. Understanding this structure and its creation is essential in fields like search technology and big data analytics.
