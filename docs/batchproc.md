# Batch Processing

Sometimes, you need to scale your program as an offline system. The input is so large that it is given as a huge file (too large to fit into main memory or even the disk of one machine), and a huge output file is expected. Your program thus becomes a batch processing job.

- **Definition**: Batch processing systems execute a series of tasks, called a batch, in a sequential manner without human intervention.
- **Scheduling**: Tasks are grouped together and processed at scheduled intervals or under specific conditions.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used for operations like data processing, file conversions, database updates, and other resource-intensive tasks.
- **Optimization**: They optimize system resources by allowing processing during off-peak times.
- **Efficiency**: This approach often leads to efficient use of computing power and can reduce operational costs.
- **Data Consistency**:  
Data Integration: Batch processing can handle large volumes of data from different sources, ensuring consistency and integration.  
Error Handling: Errors can be identified and corrected in a controlled environment before the final output is generated

## Batch Processing systems

| Type                        | Example                          | How it Works                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Payroll Processing          | Monthly salary calculations      | Collects salary details throughout the month and processes them together to generate paychecks. |
| Billing Systems             | Utility companies                | Collects usage data over the billing period and processes it in a batch to generate bills.      |
| Data Backup and Synchronization | Nightly backups                 | Collects and stores data throughout the day, running a batch process at night to back up the data. |
| Inventory Management        | Updating inventory levels        | Collects inventory data and processes it in a batch at the end of the day or week to update records. |
| Inverted Index Creation     | Google Search                    | Processes large datasets in a batch to create an inverted index, allowing efficient keyword-based search. |

### Inverted Index Creation in Google Search

- **Example:** Google's search engine.
- **How it Works:** Google uses batch processing to analyze vast amounts of web data and create an inverted index. This index lists every unique word found in the dataset and maps it to the places where it appears.
  - **Batch Processing:** The system collects data from web pages and processes it in batches, creating an index that allows for quick keyword searches.
  - **Result:** When a user searches for a term, the inverted index helps the search engine quickly find all the pages containing that term, providing fast and relevant search results.

Batch processing is a vital approach in various scenarios where **real-time processing is not necessary** or **where efficiency, simplicity, and data consistency are prioritized**. It plays a crucial role in handling large-scale data processing tasks, making it a preferred choice in many industries and applications.
