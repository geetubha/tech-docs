## Prompt Parameters

When communicating with a language model, there are several factors that can be specified to shape the conversation. Here are a few key parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                                           | Example Input                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Objective            | State the goal or purpose of the conversation.                                                        | "I want to learn about the history of the internet."                                                           |
| Role-Play            | Specify a role for the AI to assume during the conversation.                                          | "Act as a detective from a noir film."                                                                        |
| Tone                 | Indicate the desired tone of the conversation (e.g., formal, informal, friendly, serious, humorous). | "Use a humorous tone."                                                                                        |
| Technicality Level   | Request responses that match your expertise in a subject (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).    | "Explain the concept of black holes at an intermediate level."                                                |
| Length of Responses  | Specify the desired length of the responses (e.g., brief, detailed).                                  | "Give me a brief summary of the French Revolution."                                                           |
| Citation Preferences | State preferences for sources and references in responses.                                            | "Include citations from scientific journals."                                                                 |
| Bias and Neutrality  | Indicate if you want responses to be neutral, balanced, or from a specific viewpoint.                | "Give me a balanced overview of the arguments for and against climate change."                                |
| Contextual Information | Provide background information or context about the topic of conversation.                          | "I have just started learning about programming and would like to understand the difference between Python and Java." |

You can use these parameters to guide the conversation and get responses that are more tailored to your preferences and needs.

Here's an example template that incorporates these parameters:

```
Objective: To learn about the history of quantum mechanics.
Role-Play: Act as a university professor.
Tone: Formal and educational.
Technicality Level: Intermediate.
Length of Responses: Detailed.
Citation Preferences: Include references to scientific papers and books.
Bias and Neutrality: Present a balanced view of historical developments.
Contextual Information: I have a basic understanding of classical physics and am keen to learn how quantum mechanics evolved.

[Start of conversation]
```

This template would instruct the model to provide detailed, educational responses about the history of quantum mechanics with references and a balanced view as if you are in a university lecture.

Feel free to mix and match these parameters based on your needs, and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
