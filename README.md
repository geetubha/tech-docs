## Prompt Parameters

When communicating with a language model, several factors can be specified to shape the conversation. Here are a few key parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                                           | Example Input                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Objective            | State the goal or purpose of the conversation.                                                        | "I want to learn about the history of the internet."                                                           |
| Persona              | Specify a role for the AI to assume during the conversation.                                          | "Act as a detective from a noir film."                                                                        |
| Tone                 | Indicate the desired tone of the conversation (e.g., formal, informal, friendly, serious, humorous). | "Use a humorous tone."                                                                                        |
| Technicality Level   | Request responses that match your expertise in a subject (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).    | "Explain the concept of black holes at an intermediate level."                                                |
| Length of Responses  | Specify the desired length of the responses (e.g., brief, detailed).                                  | "Give me a summary of the French Revolution."                                                           |
| Citation Preferences | State preferences for sources and references in responses.                                            | "Include citations from scientific journals."                                                                 |
| Bias and Neutrality  | Indicate if you want responses to be neutral, balanced, or from a specific viewpoint.                | "Give me a balanced overview of the arguments for and against climate change."                                |
| Answer Format        | Different formats in which answers could be generated                                                 | "Give me your answers in Q&A format with bullet points, case studies & analogies"                                |
| Contextual Information | Provide background information or context about the topic of conversation.                          | "I have just started learning about programming and would like to understand the difference between Python and Java." |

You can use these parameters to guide the conversation and get responses that are more tailored to your preferences and needs.

Here's an example template that incorporates these parameters:

```
Objective: To learn about the history of quantum mechanics.
Persona: Act as a university professor.
Tone: Formal and educational.
Technicality Level: Intermediate.
Length of Responses: Detailed.
Citation Preferences: Include references to scientific papers and books.
Bias and Neutrality: Present a balanced view of historical developments.
Contextual Information: I have a basic understanding of classical physics and am keen to learn how quantum mechanics evolved.

[Start of conversation]
```

This template would instruct the model to provide detailed, educational responses about the history of quantum mechanics with references and a balanced view as if you are in a university lecture.

Feel free to mix and match these parameters based on your needs, and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

## Effect of the Parameters

Each of these parameters changes both the content & tone of the response.

So, this section would cover the effect in detail.

### Persona or Role-Play

In role-play, the AI can take on a wide range of characters, personas, or professional roles. 

The role you assign affects the tone, language, and content of the responses. 

Here are some examples of roles and how they might affect the outcome of the conversation:
